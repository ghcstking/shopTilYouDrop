		 * hello darkness my old friend\
		 * i've come to talk to with you again
		 * Because a vision slowly creeping 
		 * planted its seeds while I was sleeping
		 * ANd the vision that was planted in my brain
		 * Still remains 
		 * And whispers in the sound of silence
		 * 
		 * In restless dreams I walk alone
		 * Narrow streets of cobble stone
		 * Neath the halo of a street lamp
		 * I turned my collar to the cold and damp
		 * Till my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
		 * 
		 *
